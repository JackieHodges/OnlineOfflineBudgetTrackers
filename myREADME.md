PWA: Online Offline Budget Tracker


## Description

By adding functionality to the existing Budget Tracker application, the user is allowed to access and input data while offline. This ensures a seamless user experience.

This was accomplished by creating a manifest to tells the browser about the PWA and how it should behave once installed, implementing IndexedDB to store data while offline, and a service worker to cache the data as fetch requests are made.
